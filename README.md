# BadRandomMemeGenerator
Use Pillows and Jokes API to make a mismatched joke on top of a meme template (WIP).
Found a Jokes API that spits out random jokes while working on an assignment for class.
Thought it would be funny to use random numbers to index the setup and delivery so that the printed joke would be complete nonsense.
After finding the results (when it ran) funny I wanted to put it onto a meme template and make a file out of the results.
